                I'm a student, business owner and a husband. I love reading books that will give me value and spend a lot of my time learning computer programming and experimenting with them.

                My wife and I are married for 6 years now, we're enjoying the parenting experience but my son is super annoying because the toys are all over the place it's kind of tiring to gather those toys but you know patience is virtue &#128518;.

            <p>Anyway, nice to meet you all. And excited for this semester.</p>
